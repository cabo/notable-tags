Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   RFC 8949's original edition, RFC 7049, defined a basic set of 16 tags
   as well as a registry that can be used to contribute additional tag
   definitions [IANA.cbor-tags].  Since RFC 7049 was published, at the
   time of writing some 250 definitions of tags and ranges of tags have
   been added to that registry.

   The present document provides a roadmap to a large subset of these
   tag definitions.  Where applicable, it points to an IETF standards or
   standard development document that specifies the tag.  Where no such
   document exists, the intention is to collect specification
   information from the sources of the registrations.  After some more
   development, the present document is intended to be useful as a
   reference document for the IANA registrations of the CBOR tags the
   definitions of which have been collected.

Note to Readers

   This is an individual submission to the CBOR working group of the
   IETF, https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cbor/about/
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cbor/about/).  Discussion currently
   takes places on the github repository https://github.com/cabo/
   notable-tags (https://github.com/cabo/notable-tags).  If the CBOR WG
   believes this is a useful document, discussion is likely to move to
   the CBOR WG mailing list and a github repository at the CBOR WG
   github organization, https://github.com/cbor-wg (https://github.com/
   cbor-wg).

   The current version is true work in progress; some of the sections
   haven't been filled in yet, and in particular, permission has not
   been obtained from all authors of registered tag definitions to copy
   over their text.

Internet-Draft              Notable CBOR Tags              February 2026


   The selection of the tags presented here is somewhat arbitrary;
   considerations such as how wide the scope and area of application of
   a tag definition is combine with an assessment how "ready to use" the
   tag definition is (i.e., is the tag specification in a state where it
   can be used).

   This document can only be a snapshot of a subset of the current
   registrations.  The most up to date set of registrations is always
   available in the registry "CBOR Tags" [IANA.cbor-tags].

1.1.  The CBOR Tags Registry

   CBOR tags are an extension point of CBOR, and that extension point is
   managed through an IANA registry ([IANA.cbor-tags] as set up in
   Section 9.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]), not through publishing documents.

   Some tag ranges require a stable specification to be publicly
   available under the "Specification Required" policy (Section 4.6 of
   RFC 8126 [BCP26]).  That stable availability can be provided by any
   suitable means, such as a (specific revision of a) GitHub repository,
   a document published by an SDO or other entity, or even by a specific
   revision of an Internet-Draft, or an RFC if that happens to be in the
   pipeline.  (In the latter case, while the RFC is being developed, the
   allocation will probably be made when that RFC still is in Internet-
   Draft state, which is then referenced in the registry and is usually
   updated to the RFC number when that is published.)

   An example for this is provided by Section 9.1 of the present
   document.  A few allocations were made for these tags (101, 121-127,
   1280-1400) that are now a permanent part of the CBOR Tags registry.
   These allocations do reference revision –07 of the present Internet-
   Draft, because that contains an explanation of what these tags are
   supposed to be used for.  That document revision –07 is part of the
   permanent record of the IETF and is not going away, so we are able to
   use it as a stable part of the information provided with the
   allocation.  (In more recent revisions of the present document, some
   glue text was updated and a clerical error in illustrative CDDL code
   was fixed; eventually, there may be some incentive to update the
   registry entry to a newer revision of the present document.)

   As with other stable specifications referenced this way, there is no
   need for the present document to be a published RFC before the tags
   become useful; i.e., the publication action that makes the tag
   numbers available for wide use in interchange is the acceptance of
   the tags into the IANA CBOR Tags registry.

Internet-Draft              Notable CBOR Tags              February 2026


      |  One example of an Internet-Draft-based specification document
      |  that eventually did get published as an RFC is given by the
      |  CBOR Tags for Time, Duration, and Period [RFC9581].  These were
      |  originally registered around 2017 (under the original policy
      |  for these registrations) with a reference to
      |  [I-D.draft-bormann-cbor-time-tag-01].  Over time, the document
      |  evolved into a WG document without a need to update the
      |  reference.  The registration was finally updated to point to
      |  [RFC9581] when that was published, which was also the time
      |  additional registries were created for some of the inner
      |  workings of the time tags.

1.2.  Terminology

   The definitions of [STD94] apply.  Specifically: The term "byte" is
   used in its now customary sense as a synonym for "octet"; "byte
   strings" are CBOR data items carrying a sequence of zero or more
   (binary) bytes, while "text strings" are CBOR data items carrying a
   sequence of zero or more Unicode scalar values (code points that can
   be part of a string of Unicode characters), encoded in UTF-8 [STD63].
   Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
   familiar from the programming language C ([C], including C++14's
   0bnnn binary literals [Cplusplus20]), except that superscript
   notation (example for two to the power of 64: 2^64) denotes
   exponentiation; in the plain text version of this document,
   superscript notation is rendered in paragraph text by C-incompatible
   surrogate notation as seen in this example.  Ranges expressed using
   .. are inclusive of the limits given.  Type names such as "int",
   "bigint" or "decfrac" are taken from Appendix D of [RFC8610], the
   Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL).

2.  RFC 7049 (original CBOR specification)

   [RFC7049] defines a number of tags that are listed here for
   convenience only.

                  Table 1: Tag numbers defined in RFC 7049

2.1.  Tags Related to Those Defined in RFC 7049

   Separately registered tags that are directly related to the tags
   predefined in RFC 7049 include:

   *  Tag 63, registered by this document (Section 12), is a parallel to
      tag 24, with the single difference that its byte string tag
      content carries a CBOR Sequence [RFC8742] instead of a single
      encoded CBOR data item.

Internet-Draft              Notable CBOR Tags              February 2026


   *  Tag 108, registered by this document (Section 12), is a parallel
      to tag 23, with the single difference that the hexadecimal form
      uses lowercase instead of uppercase letters.




         Note that tag 23 has a serialization that is one byte
            shorter than tag 108, so if all else is equal, tag 23 (and
            thus upper case hex) would be chosen as it is slightly more
            efficient than tag 108.  However, designers of CBOR
            protocols that use one of these tags often have reason to
            prefer lowercase hex in the application they are trying to
            be compatible with, in which case 108 provides a solution
            that is only one byte more expensive.

   *  Tag 257, registered by Peter Occil with a specification in
      http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/binarymime.html
      (http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/binarymime.html), is a parallel
      to tag 36, except that the tag content is a byte string, which
      therefore can also carry binary MIME messages as per [RFC2045].

   *  Tag 21065, having been registered by this document (Section 12),
      is a parallel to tag 35, with the difference that its text string
      tag content carries an I-Regexp regular expression [RFC9485]
      instead of a regexp of a more unspecified flavor.  Companion tag
      21066, having been registered by Joe Hildebrand with a
      specification in https://github.com/hildjj/cbor-specs/blob/main/
      regexp.md (https://github.com/hildjj/cbor-specs/blob/main/
      regexp.md), is the equivalent for JavaScript (ECMA262), but
      besides the regular expression itself also can include the regular
      expression flags as a separate item.

2.2.  Tags from RFC 7049 not listed in RFC 8949

   Appendix G.3 of RFC 8949 [STD94] states:

   |  Tag 35 is not defined by this document; the registration based on
   |  the definition in RFC 7049 remains in place.

   The reason for this exclusion is that the definition of Tag 35 in
   Section 2.4.4.3 of [RFC7049], leaves too much open to ensure
   interoperability:

   |  Tag 35 is for regular expressions in Perl Compatible Regular
   |  Expressions (PCRE) / JavaScript syntax [ECMA262].

   Not only are two partially incompatible specifications given for the
   semantics, JavaScript regular expressions have also developed
   significantly within the decade since JavaScript 5.1 (which was
   referenced as "ECMA262" by [RFC7049]), making it less reliable to
   assume that a producing application will manage to stay within that
   2011 subset.

   Nonetheless, the registration is in place, so it is available for
   applications that simply want to mark a text string as being a
   regular expression roughly of the PCRE/Javascript flavor families.
   See also Tag 21065 and 21066 above.

3.  Security

   A number of CBOR tags are defined in security specifications that
   make use of CBOR.

   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is defined in a number of
   RFCs.  [RFC8152] was the initial specification, set up the
   registries, and populated them with an initial set of assignments.  A
   revision split this specification into the data structure definitions
   (RFC9052), an Internet Standard [STD96], and a separate document
   defining the representation for the algorithms employed [RFC9053],
   which is expected to be updated more frequently than the COSE format
   itself.  [RFC9054] added a separate set of algorithms for
   cryptographic hash functions (Hash functions have been a component of
   some [RFC9053] combined algorithms but weren't originally assigned
   separate codepoints themselves).  A revised COSE counter signature
   structure was defined in RFC9338, another part of [STD96]; this also
   defines a tag for these.

        Table 2: Tag numbers defined in RFC9052, COSE, and RFC 9338

3.1.1.  Tags for Bare Hash Values

   [RFC9054] does not define CBOR tags for cryptographic Hash values; it
   rightly notes that Hash values are often used in structures that are
   application-specific and should be defined with those applications.

   However, there are many cases where just a bare hash value is
   required, and for these cases common tags are useful.  In one use
   case, these tags occur in a data structure that is specified to
   indicate elision by using one of these tags as an alternative to some
   other data structure.  To enable agility, tags need to indicate the
   hash function used, preferably using the COSE algorithms registry as
   populated by [RFC9054].

      |  (Note that there is another registry, "Named Information Hash
      |  Algorithm Registry" [IANA.named-information], that also defines
      |  numbers for some hash algorithms.  We are not using this
      |  registry here, as more recent entries seem to have stopped
      |  assigning numbers.  If desired, tags that employ this registry
      |  could be added later.)

   The codepoint range available for the COSE algorithms registry is
   large, but the most likely range to be used for standard Hash
   functions is "Integer values between -256 and 255", which have the
   registry policy "Standards Action With Expert Review" (Section 16.4
   of [RFC8152], Registry "COSE Algorithms" [IANA.cose]).

   To this end, the present document registers a range of 512 tags from
   18300 to 18811 (inclusive), paralleling the algorithm identifier
   range of -256 .. 255 (inclusive).  The tag number for COSE algorithm
   number N is then defined to be 18556+N, except for N = 0 (see below).
   The tag value is a CBOR byte string, with the exception N = 0.

   For example, in [IANA.cose] SHA-256 has the COSE algorithm identifier
   -16.  This is in the range -256 .. 255 (inclusive range).  Therefore,
   tag 18540 (= 18556 + (-16)) is the tag for a byte string containing a
   SHA-256 hash.

   As a special case, there is one exception: Tag 18556 (= 18556 + 0)
   stands for the combination of a an explicit numeric COSE algorithm
   identifier with a hash value in an array, analogous to the use of
   COSE_CertHash in [RFC9360]:

   Standard_COSE_Hash<alg, value> =
       #6.<hashmiddle .plus (alg .within directhash)>(value)
   General_COSE_Hash<alg, value> = #6.<hashmiddle>([
       hashAlg: alg .within (int .ne directhash  / tstr),
       hashValue: value .within bstr ])
   hashmiddle = 18556
   directhash = (-256 .. -1) / (1 .. 255)

   As none has been registered, no real example can be given for a hash
   algorithm with an identifier not in the standard range, but if -4711
   were such an identifier, a hash with an explicit algorithm number
   could look like:

   18556([-4711, h'1234123412341234123412341234123412341234'])

   Note that not all tags assigned in this section do parallel an
   algorithm that is a cryptographic hash algorithm.  Where this is not
   the case, there currently is no defined semantics for this tag, but
   the tags are assigned anyway.  The semantics of tags that parallel
   algorithm assignments other than for cryptographic hash functions
   could be defined by a future version of this specification.

   Note also that the cryptographic hashes in the content of the tag are
   not protected; any further protection (confidentiality, integrity)
   needs to be provided in the surrounding data structure, storage
   system, or communication channel.

3.2.  RFC 8392 (CWT)

   [RFC8392] defines the CBOR Web Token (CWT), making use of COSE to
   define a CBOR variant of the JOSE Web Token (JWT), [RFC7519], a
   standardized security token that has found use in the area of web
   applications, but is not technically limited to those.

   Representation formats can be built on top of CBOR.

4.1.  YANG-CBOR

   YANG [RFC7950] is a data modeling language originally designed in the
   context of the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241],
   now widely used for modeling management and configuration
   information.  [RFC7950] defines an XML-based representation format,
   and [RFC7951] defines a JSON-based [RFC8259] representation format
   for YANG.

   [I-D.bormann-cbor-yang-standin] proposes to employ additional tags to
   enable the use of efficient binary encodings for certain frequently
   used YANG data types [RFC9911].

5.  Protocols

   Protocols may want to allocate CBOR tag numbers to identify specific
   protocol elements.

5.1.  DOTS

   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) defines tag number 271 for the DOTS
   signal channel object in [RFC9132].

5.2.  RAINS

   As an example for how experimental protocols can make use of CBOR tag
   definitions, the RAINS (Another Internet Naming Service) Protocol
   Specification defines tag number 15309736 for a RAINS Message
   [I-D.trammell-rains-protocol].  (The seemingly random tag number was
   chosen so that, when represented as an encoded CBOR tag argument, it
   contains the Unicode character "雨" (U+96E8) in UTF-8, which
   represents rain in a number of languages.)

   A number of tags have been registered for arithmetic representations
   beyond those built into CBOR and defined by tags in [RFC7049].  These

                  Table 5: Tags for advanced arithmetic

   CBOR's basic generic data model (Section 2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) has a
   number system with limited-range integers (major types 0 and 1:
   -2^64..2^64-1) and floating point numbers that cover binary16,
   binary32, and binary64 (including non-finites) from [IEEE754].  With
   the tags defined with [RFC7049], the extended generic data model
   (Section 2.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) adds unlimited-range integers (tag
   numbers 2 and 3, "bigint" in CDDL) as well as floating point values
   using the bases 2 (tag number 5, "bigfloat") and 10 (tag number 4,
   "decfrac").

   This pre-defined number system has a number of limitations that are
   addressed in three of the tags discussed here:

   *  Tag number 30 allows the representation of rational numbers as a
      ratio of two integers: a numerator (usually written as the top
      part of a fraction), and a denominator (the bottom part), where
      both integers can be limited-range basic and unlimited-range
      integers.  The mathematical value of a rational number is the
      numerator divided by the denominator.  This tag can express all
      numbers that the extended generic data model of [RFC7049] can
      express, except for non-finites [IEEE754]; it also can express
      rational numbers that cannot be expressed with denominators that
      are a power of 2 or a power of 10.

      For example, the rational number 1/3 is encoded:

        d8 1e      ---- Tag 30
           82      ---- Array length 2
              01   ---- 1
              03   ---- 3

      Many programming languages have built-in support for rational
      numbers or support for them is included in their standard
      libraries; tag number 30 is a way for these platforms to
      interchange these rational numbers in CBOR.

   *  Tag numbers 4 and 5 are limited in the range of the (base 10 or
      base 2) exponents by the limited-range integers in the basic
      generic data model.  Tag numbers 264 and 265 are exactly
      equivalent to 4 and 5, respectively, but also allow unlimited-
      range integers as exponents.  While applications for floating
      point numbers with exponents outside the CBOR basic integer range
      are limited, tags 264 and 265 allow unlimited roundtripping with
      other formats that allow very large or very small exponents, such
      as those JSON [RFC8259] can provide if the limitations of I-JSON
      [RFC7493] do not apply.

   The tag numbers 268..270 extend these tags further by providing a way
   to express non-finites within a tag with this number.  This does not
   increase the expressiveness of the data model (the non-finites can
   already be expressed using major type 7 floating point numbers), but
   does allow both finite and non-finite values to carry the same tag.
   In most applications, a choice that includes some of the three tags
   30, 264, 265 for finite values and major type 7 floating point values
   for non-finites (as well as possibly other parts of the CBOR number
   system) will be the preferred solution.

   This document suggests using the CDDL typenames defined in Figure 2
   for the three most useful tag numbers in this section.

                    Table 7: Select Domain-Specific Tags

   Notes:

   *  In the registration for Tag 37, the reference for UUID has been
      updated from [RFC4122] to [RFC9562].  The new RFC has a somewhat
      different internal structure; the definition of the layout of a
      binary UUID is now distributed over Section 5 of [RFC9562].

   *  Tags 48, 52, and 54 are recommended for new designs that need to
      represent MAC addresses, IP addresses, and IP address prefixes;
      they essentially replace tags 260 and 261, which continue to be
      available for their existing applications.

   *  Tag 263 describes a different kind of Hexadecimal string (sequence
      of hex digit pairs, same layout as tag 23) from the hex-string
      defined by the YANG data type hex-string (sequence of hex digit
      pairs separated by colons, Section 3 of [RFC9911]).

7.1.  Human-readable Text

        +-----+-----------+------------------------+--------------+

                Table 8: Select Tags for Human-readable Text

   Tag 38 was originally registered by Peter Occil in
   http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/langtags.html
   (http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/langtags.html); it has since been
   adopted and extended in Appendix A of [RFC9290], where a detailed
   definition of the tag and a few simple examples for its use are
   provided.

   The problem that this tag was designed to solve is that text strings
   often need additional information to be properly presented to a
   human.  While Unicode (and the UTF-8 form of Unicode used in CBOR)
   define the characters, additional information about the human
   language in use and the writing direction appropriate for the text
   given are often required.

   The need to provide language information with text has been well-
   known for a while and led to a common form for this information, the
   language tag, defined in [BCP47].

   Less well-known is the need to provide separate directionality
   information as well.  The need for this information is demonstrated
   in [W3C-STRINGS-BIDI], which points out that it is "actually a bad
   idea to rely on language information to apply direction" and points
   out further reference information on this.  [W3C-BIDI-USE-CASES]
   shows more examples for language tags and directionality, while
   [W3C-UBA-BASICS] provides an introduction to the way browsers, where
   "the order of characters in memory (logical) is not the same as the
   order in which they are displayed (visual)", "produce the correct
   order at the time of display" (Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm).

   Tag 38 meets the requirements of its specific application in
   [RFC9290], which could be summarized as: Supplying the necessary
   information to present isolated, linear, comparatively small pieces
   of human-readable text.  It neither addresses more complex
   requirements of specific languages such as [W3C-SIMPLE-RUBY], nor
   does it address requirements for more complex structure in texts such
   as emphasis, lists, or tables.  These more complex requirements are
   typically met by specific media types such as HTML [HTML].

   Additional tag definitions have been provided for date and time
   values.

   Note that tags 100 and 1004 are for calendar dates that are not
   anchored to a specific time zone; they are meant to specify calendar
   dates as perceived by humans, e.g. for use in personal identification
   documents.  Converting such a calendar date into a specific point in
   time needs the addition of a time-of-day (for which a CBOR tag is
   outstanding) and timezone information (also outstanding).
   Alternatively, a calendar date plus timezone information can be
   converted into a time period (range of time values given by the
   starting and the ending time); note that these time periods are not
   always exactly 24 h (86400 s) long.

   [RFC8943] does not suggest CDDL [RFC8610] type names for the two
   tags.  We suggest copying the definitions in Figure 3 into
   application-specific CDDL as needed.

   caldate = #6.100(int); calendar date as # of days from 1970-01-01
   tcaldate = #6.1004(tstr); calendar date as RFC 3339 full-date string

              Figure 3: CDDL for calendar date tags (RFC8943)

   Tag 1001 extends tag 1 by additional information (such as picosecond
   resolution) and allows the use of Decimal and Bigfloat numbers for
   the time.

   (These are actually not as Perl-specific as the title of this section
   suggests.  See also the penultimate paragraph of Section 3.4 of RFC
   8949 [STD94].)

   pathname component is given in Table 10.

8.2.  JSON

   (TO DO: Obtain permission to copy the definitions here.)

   Tag number 262 has been registered to identify byte strings that
   carry embedded JSON text (https://github.com/toravir/CBOR-Tag-
   Specs/blob/master/embeddedJSON.md).  This is an analog to tag 24 for
   embedded Encoded CBOR Data Items.

   Tag number 275 can be used to identify maps that contain keys that
   are all of type Text String, as they would occur in JSON
   (https://github.com/ecorm/cbor-tag-text-key-map).

8.3.  Weird text encodings

   (TO DO: Obtain permission to copy the definitions here.)

   Some variants of UTF-8 are in use in specific areas of application.
   Tags have been registered to be able to carry around strings
   identified as to which of these variants is used, in case they are
   not also valid UTF-8 and can therefore not be represented as a CBOR
   text string (https://github.com/svaarala/cbor-specs/blob/master/cbor-
   nonutf8-string-tags.rst).

           Table 13: Tags for Enumerated Alternative Data Items

   The tags defined in this section are for encoding data that can be in
   one of a number of different enumerated forms.

   For example data representing the result of some action might be
   either a failure with some failure detail, or a success with some
   result.  In this example there are two cases, the failure case and
   the success case, and we can enumerate them as 0 and 1.

   In general the number of alternatives, and what data is expected in
   each alternative case is entirely application dependent.

   The tags defined in this specification allow the encoding of any
   number of alternatives, but provide compact encoding for the common
   cases of low numbers of alternatives:

   *  Alternatives 0..6 can be encoded in 2 bytes;

   *  Alternatives 7..127 can be encoded in 3 bytes;

   *  Alternatives 128+ can be encoded in 3-12 bytes.

   There are no special considerations for deterministic encoding
   Section 4.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]: The case numbers covered by each tag
   do not overlap; particularly, tag 101 encoding starts where the more
   compact special encodings for 0..6 and 7..127 end.

   For cases 0..6 and 7..127, the tag value indicates the value of the
   alternative.  For cases 128+, a single tag number is used with an
   enclosed two-element array that contains the case number and the
   value of the alternative.

9.1.1.  Semantics

   The value consists of a case number and a case body.  The case number
   is an unsigned integer that indicates which case out of the set of
   alternatives is used.  The case body is any CBOR data value.

   In a setting where the application uses a schema (formally or
   informally), then there will be an appropriate sub-schema for each
   case in the set of alternatives.  The representation of the case body
   should comply with the schema corresponding to the case number used.

   To continue the example above about representing failure or success,
   suppose that the failure detail consists of an integer code and a
   string, and suppose that the successful result is a byte string.  A
   failure value will use case 0 and the case body will be a CBOR list
   containing an integer and a text string.  Alternatively, a success
   value will use case 1 and the body will be a single CBOR byte string.

   Decoders that enforce a schema must check the case number is within
   the range of cases allowed, and that the case body follows the schema
   for the supplied case number.  Generic decoders should allow any case
   number and any CBOR data value for the case body.

9.1.2.  Rationale

   CBOR has direct support for _combinations_ of multiple values but not
   for _alternatives_ of multiple values.  Combinations are expressed in
   CBOR using lists or maps.

   Most programming languages have a notion of data consisting of
   combinations of data values, often called records, structs or
   objects.  Many programming languages also have a notion of data
   consisting of multiple alternative data values.  For example C has
   unions, and other languages have "tagged" unions (where it is always
   clear which alternative is in use).

   Crucially for this set of tags, the set of alternatives must be
   closed and ordered.  This allows encoding using an unsigned number to
   distinguish each case.

   Note that this does _not_ correspond to the notion in some
   programming languages of classes and subclasses since in that context
   the set of alternatives is open and unordered.  Alternatives of this
   kind are well-supported by tag 27 "Serialized language-independent
   object with type name and constructor arguments".

   In functional programming languages, the primary way of forming new
   data types is to enumerate a set of alternatives (each of which may
   be a record).  Such forms of data are also supported in hybrid
   functional languages or languages with functional features.

   Thus, in some applications, it is very common to have data making use
   of alternatives, and it is worth finding a compact encoding, at least
   for the common cases.  Just as most records are small, most
   alternatives are also small.

   In this specification we reserve 7 values in the 2-byte part of the
   available tag encoding space for alternatives 0..6 which are by far
   the most common.  We reserve a range of 121 values in the 3-bytes tag
   encoding space.  To cover the general case we use an encoding using a
   pair consisting of an unsigned integer and the case body, the first
   24 of which also result in a 3-byte encoding.

9.1.3.  Examples

   To elaborate on the example from the introduction, we have a "result"
   that is a failure or success, where:

   *  the failure detail consists of an integer code and a string;

   *  the successful result is a byte string.

   This corresponds to the following schema, in CDDL notation:

   result = #6.121([int, text])
          / #6.122(bytes)

   Example values:

   121([3, "the printer is on fire"])

   122(h'ff00')

   As a second example, here is one based on a data type defined within
   the Haskell programming language, representing a simple expression
   tree.

   -- A data type representing simple arithmetic expressions

   data Expr = Lit Int -- integer literal
   | Add Expr Expr -- addition
   | Sub Expr Expr -- subtraction
   | Neg Expr -- unary negation
   | Mul Expr Expr -- multiplication
   | Div Expr Expr -- integer division

   In CDDL notation, and using the tags in this specification, such data
   could be encoded using this schema:

   ; A data type representing simple arithmetic expressions

   expr = #6.121(int)          ; integer literal
        / #6.122([expr, expr]) ; addition
        / #6.123([expr, expr]) ; subtraction
        / #6.124(expr)         ; unary negation
        / #6.125([expr, expr]) ; multiplication
        / #6.126([expr, expr]) ; integer division

10.  Implementation aids

10.1.  Invalid Tag

   The present document registers tag numbers 65535, 4294967295, and
   18446744073709551615 (16-bit 0xffff, 32-bit 0xffffffff, and 64-bit
   0xffffffffffffffff) as Invalid Tags, tags that are always invalid,
   independent of the tag content provided.  The purpose of these tag
   number registrations is to enable the tag numbers to be reserved for
   internal use by implementations to note the absence of a tag on a
   data item where a tag could also be expected with that data item as
   tag content.

   The Invalid Tags are not intended to ever occur in interchanged CBOR
   data items.  Generic CBOR decoder implementations are encouraged to
   raise an error if an Invalid Tag occurs in a CBOR data item even if
   there is no validity checking implemented otherwise.

10.2.  Programming Aid for Simple Values

   In a similar way, the present document also registers tag number
   21334 as a fourth Invalid Tag. This tag is set aside specifically for
   use by CBOR implementations that have no natural way to represent
   Simple Values (Section 3.3 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) beyond false, true,
   or null in their programming interface.  For instance, such
   implementations can represent simple(123) as 21334(123) in the
   programming interface.

10.3.  Test Tag

   CBOR implementations should handle tags that they do not understand,
   usually by creating an instance of an object that contains the tag
   number and the associated data item.  In order to test this code,
   there needs to be a tag number that will never be allocated for some
   new semantics.  This property also makes the tag number safe to use
   as a placeholder in documentation, such as in illustrative examples
   that show a hypothetical tag, without creating expectations for
   future registration.

   This section specifies a CBOR tag for testing purposes:

11.  Managing redundancy

   A CBOR data item often has appreciable internal redundancy, for
   instance by serializing certain strings again and again.

   Data compression specifications such as deflate [RFC1951], gzip
   [RFC1952], brotli [RFC7932], zstd [RFC8878], and dcb/dcz [RFC9842]
   provide powerful ways to provide compressed representations of
   encoded data items that exhibit internal redundancy.  While these can
   provide very good compression ratios, the disadvantage of applying
   traditional data compression is that the serialized data need to
   undergo a separate compression pass at the producer and a
   decompression pass at the consumer before the data items can be
   accessed again.

   An alternative is to perform some management of redundancy not at the
   level of serialized data, but at the data model level, i.e., within
   the data items interchanged.  This can enable a CBOR library to
   perform redundancy reduction ("packing") and unpacking on the fly.
   This section discusses tag sets that can be used for this.

11.1.  Packed CBOR

   A comprehensive approach to reducing redundancy by packing is
   provided by the set of tags and simple values defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed], which see.

11.2.  Stringref

   A very simple mechanism that is focused just on the redundancy of
   repeated (byte or text) strings is _stringref_ [STRINGREF],
   originally designed in the context of the Perl platform
   (Section 8.1), but now implemented on other platforms, too.

   With some additional care, the stringref mechanism can be used in a
   general fashion; this section will briefly introduce stringref and
   ways to use it that are fully interoperable.

11.2.1.  Stringref Mechanism

   Stringref works by silently entering (byte or text) strings in a
   table that maps between unsigned integers ("index" values) and the
   string value (including whether it is a text or a byte string).  On
   the producer side, an entry is added to the table when the specific
   string value is encoded for the first time.  This allows all further
   copies of the same string to be expressed by just referencing the
   table entry by its index (sequence number).  This reference is
   expressed via tag 25, carrying the index as an unsigned integer.  The
   table entry is only added if representing the string itself would be
   longer than a reference via tag 25, i.e., the string needs to have a
   minimum length in bytes as per Table 15 to get a table entry.

               Table 15: Stringref: Minimum String Length for
                         Creating a New Table Entry

   Note that there is no requirement for the producer of the encoded
   CBOR data item to actually make use of a table entry; this means that
   inexact ("lossy") representations of the table can be used at the
   producer, as long as the highest index is properly incremented on any
   string actually encoded as such.  (If an actual string is indeed
   emitted again, the new copy gets a new table entry.)

   The consumer side follows the decisions of the producer, i.e., any
   (text or byte) string encountered in the encoded data item that is
   minimum size or larger leads to a new entry in the table at the
   lowest current unfilled index and thus to incrementing the highest
   index in use.

11.2.2.  Stringref Namespaces

   Employing stringref (tag 25) places an onus on CBOR libraries both
   during emission and during ingestion: Both have to manage their own
   mapping table and examine it repeatedly, possibly adding an entry for
   another index/string mapping to it, each time a string is processed.

   To incur this overhead only when needed, stringref references are
   only valid within the tag content of a tag with tag number 256,
   _stringref-namespace_ (tag content: any).  A library that implements
   stringref ingestion can switch on stringref processing when that tag
   is encountered, and switch it off again when its processing leaves
   the tag 256 tag content.  A producer can localize the effort needed
   at both ends by placing the tag at a position in the hierarchy that
   merits the additional processing.

Internet-Draft              Notable CBOR Tags              February 2026


   Stringref namespaces also provide a basic form of composability: If
   another tag 256 is encountered within the content of a tag 256, a new
   mapping table ("namespace") is created and the processing of strings
   and tags 25 within the tag content of the inner tag operates starting
   at index 0, independently of the processing of the tag content of the
   outer tag outside the inner tag.  (After leaving the inner tag 256,
   the processing continues using the table generated by the outer tag
   256.)

11.2.3.  Serialization Considerations

   As defined, stringref has a dependency on serialization order.  Like
   JSON objects, CBOR maps do not have a defined order in processing,
   and both encoders and decoders might employ their own preferred order
   when that is beneficial on the specific platform.  Stringref's
   implicit filling of the mapping table only works correctly when
   producer and consumer agree on this order.

   So far, this looming interoperability problem has kept stringref
   confined to some niche applications.  However, stringref can be used
   without a danger of disagreeing map orders in conjunction with a
   deterministic encoding serialization constraint, such as CDE, which
   binds both sides to the same ordering of entries in a map
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cde].

   Using CDE also solves another problem with stringref as defined: The
   tags' specification says that it only applies to definite-length-
   encoded strings.  Here as well, the component doing the stringref
   processing may have no control over which serialization is used in
   the encoder and no information about the serialization used from the
   decoder.  Since CDE incorporates the serialization constraint
   "definite length only" (DLO), no disagreement can happen when those
   serialization constraints are followed.

   The present specification therefore recommends using stringref only
   in environments where a deterministic encoding with a DLO
   serialization constraint, such as CDE (or LDE), is followed.

12.  IANA Considerations

   In the registry "CBOR Tags" [IANA.cbor-tags], IANA has allocated the
   first to third tag in Table 16 from the First Come First Served
   (FCFS) space, with the present document as the specification
   reference.  IANA also has allocated the tags in the next seven rows
   from the Specification Required space, with the present document as
   the specification reference, as well as the tag in the final row from
   the FCFS range.
