--- abstract

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
need for version negotiation.

In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
RFC 8949's original edition, RFC 7049, defined a basic set of tags as well
as a registry that can be used to contribute additional tag
definitions {{-tags}}.  Since RFC 7049 was published, some 80 tag
definitions have been added to that registry.

The present document provides a roadmap to a large subset of these tag
definitions.  Where applicable, it points to a IETF standards or
standard development document
that specifies the tag.  Where no such document exists, the intention
is to collect specification information from the sources of the
registrations.  After some more development, the present document is
intended to be useful as a reference document for the IANA
registrations of the CBOR tags the definitions of which have been
collected.

--- note_Note_to_Readers

This is an individual submission to the CBOR working group of the
IETF, <https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cbor/about/>.
Discussion currently takes places on the github repository
<https://github.com/cabo/notable-tags>.
If the CBOR WG believes this is a useful document, discussion is
likely to move to the CBOR WG mailing list and a github repository at
the CBOR WG github organization, <https://github.com/cbor-wg>.

The current version is true work in progress; some of the sections
haven't been filled in yet, and in particular, permission has not been
obtained from tag definition authors to copy over their text.

Introduction        {#intro}
============

(TO DO, expand on text from abstract here; move references here and
neuter them in the abstract as per {{Section 4.3 of ?RFC7322}}.)

The selection of the tags presented here is somewhat arbitrary;
considerations such as how wide the scope and area of application of a
tag definition is combine with an assessment how "ready to use" the
tag definition is (i.e., is the tag specification in a state where it
can be used).

This document can only be a snapshot of a subset of the current registrations.
The most up to date set of registrations is always available in the
registry "{{cbor-tags (CBOR Tags)<IANA.cbor-tags}}" {{IANA.cbor-tags}}.

Terminology         {#terms}
------------

The definitions of {{-cbor}} apply.
Specifically: The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
"octet"; "byte strings" are CBOR data items carrying a sequence of
zero or more (binary) bytes, while "text strings" are CBOR data items carrying a
sequence of zero or more Unicode code points, encoded in UTF-8 {{-utf8}}.
Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
familiar from the programming language C ({{C}}, including C++14's `0bnnn`
binary literals {{Cplusplus20}}), except that superscript notation
(example for two to the power of 64: 2<sup>64</sup>) denotes exponentiation; in
the plain text version of this document, superscript notation is
rendered in paragraph text by C-incompatible surrogate notation as
seen in this example.
Ranges expressed using `..` are inclusive of the limits given.
<!-- , and in display math by a crude plain text representation. -->
Type names such as "int", "bigint" or "decfrac" are taken from
{{Section D of -cddl}}, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL).

# RFC 7049 (original CBOR specification)

{{-orig}} defines a number of tags that are listed here for
convenience only.

| Tag number | Tag content  | Short Description                         | Section of RFC 7049 |

## Tags Related to Those Defined in RFC 7049 {#related-tags}

Separately registered tags that are directly related to the tags
predefined in RFC 7049 include:

* Tag 63, registered by this document, is a parallel to tag 24, with
  the single difference that its byte string tag content carries a
  CBOR Sequence {{-seq}} instead of a single CBOR data item.

* Tag 257, registered by Peter Occil with a specification in
  <http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/binarymime.html>, is a parallel to
  tag 36, except that the tag content is a byte string, which
  therefore can also carry binary MIME messages as per {{-mime}}.

## Tags from RFC 7049 not listed in RFC 8949

<!-- Note that xml2rfc generates a broken reference for {{Appendix G.3 of -cbor}}, so we -->
<!-- work around manually: -->

{{section-g.3-9 (Appendix G.3)<STD94}} of {{-cbor}} states:

{:quote}
>
   Tag 35 is not defined by this document; the registration based on the
   definition in RFC 7049 remains in place.

The reason for this exclusion is that the definition of Tag 35 in
{{Section 2.4.4.3 of -orig}}, leaves too much open to ensure interoperability:

{:quote}
>
  Tag 35 is for regular expressions in Perl Compatible Regular
  Expressions (PCRE) / JavaScript syntax \[ECMA262].

Not only are two partially incompatible specifications given for the
semantics, JavaScript regular expressions have also developed
significantly within the decade since JavaScript 5.1 (which was
referenced as "ECMA262" by {{-orig}}),
making it less reliable to assume that a producing application will
manage to stay within that 2011 subset.

Nonetheless, the registration is in place, so it is available for
applications that simply want to mark a text string as being a regular
expression roughly of the PCRE/Javascript flavor families.

# Security

A number of CBOR tags are defined in security specifications that make
use of CBOR.

## RFC 8152 (COSE)

{{!RFC8152}} defines CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).
A revision is in process that splits this specification into the data
structure definitions {{?I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct}}, which will
define another tag for COSE standalone counter signature, and the
algorithms employed {{?I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs}}.

| Tag number | Tag content   | Short Description                           |
|         16 | COSE_Encrypt0 | COSE Single Recipient Encrypted Data Object |
|         17 | COSE_Mac0     | COSE Mac w/o Recipients Object              |
|         18 | COSE_Sign1    | COSE Single Signer Data Object              |
|         96 | COSE_Encrypt  | COSE Encrypted Data Object                  |
|         97 | COSE_Mac      | COSE MACed Data Object                      |
|         98 | COSE_Sign     | COSE Signed Data Object                     |
{: #cosetags title="Tag numbers defined in RFC 8152, COSE"}

## RFC 8392 (CWT)

{{!RFC8392}} defines the CBOR Web Token (CWT), making use of COSE to
define a CBOR variant of the JOSE Web Token (JWT), {{?RFC7519}}, a
standardized security token that has found use in the area of web
applications, but is not technically limited to those.

| Tag number | Tag content          | Short Description    |
|         61 | CBOR Web Token (CWT) | CBOR Web Token (CWT) |
{: #cwttags title="Tag number defined for RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token (CWT)"}

# CBOR-based Representation Formats

Representation formats can be built on top of CBOR.

## YANG-CBOR

YANG {{?RFC7950}} is a data modeling language originally designed in
the context of the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
{{?RFC6241}}, now widely used for modeling management and
configuration information.  {{?RFC7950}} defines an XML-based
representation format, and {{?RFC7951}} defines a JSON-based
{{-json}} representation format for YANG.

YANG-CBOR {{!I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor}} is a representation format for
YANG data in CBOR.

| Tag number | Tag content                              | Short Description                 | Section of YANG-CBOR |
|         43 | byte string                              | YANG bits datatype                |                  6.7 |
|         44 | unsigned integer                         | YANG enumeration datatype         |                  6.6 |
|         45 | unsigned integer or text string          | YANG identityref datatype         |                 6.10 |
|         46 | unsigned integer or text string or array | YANG instance-identifier datatype |                 6.13 |
|         47 | unsigned integer                         | YANG Schema Item iDentifier (sid) |                  3.2 |
{: #yangtags title="Tag number defined for YANG-CBOR"}

# Protocols

Protocols may want to allocate CBOR tag numbers to identify specific
protocol elements.

## DOTS

DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) defines tag number 271 for the DOTS
signal channel object in {{!RFC9132}}.

## RAINS

As an example for how experimental protocols can make use of CBOR tag
definitions, the RAINS (Another Internet Naming Service) Protocol
Specification defines tag number 15309736 for a RAINS Message
{{?I-D.trammell-rains-protocol}}.
(The seemingly random tag number was chosen so that, when represented
as an encoded CBOR tag
argument, it contains the Unicode character <u format="lit-num">雨</u>
in UTF-8, which represents rain in a number of languages.)


# Datatypes

## Advanced arithmetic

A number of tags have been registered for arithmetic representations
beyond those built into CBOR and defined by tags in {{-orig}}.
These are all documented under `http://peteroupc.github.io/CBOR/`; the
last pathname component for the URL is given in {{arithtags}}.

| Tag number | Tag content | Short Description                         | Reference     |
|         30 | array       | Rational number                           | rational.html |
|        264 | array       | Decimal fraction with arbitrary  exponent | bigfrac.html  |

{: #arithtags title="Tags for advanced arithmetic"}

CBOR's basic generic data model ({{Section 2 of -cbor}}) has a number
system with limited-range integers (major types 0 and 1:
-2<sup>64</sup>..2<sup>64</sup>-1) and floating point numbers that
cover binary16, binary32, and binary64 (including non-finites) from
{{IEEE754}}.
With the tags defined with {{-orig}}, the extended generic data model
({{Section 2.1 of -cbor}}) adds unlimited-range integers (tag numbers 2
and 3, "bigint" in CDDL) as well as floating point values using the bases
2 (tag number 5, "bigfloat") and 10 (tag number 4, "decfrac").

This pre-defined number system has a number of limitations that are
addressed in three of the tags discussed here:

* Tag number 30 allows the representation of rational numbers as a
  ratio of two integers: a numerator (usually written as the top part
  of a fraction), and a denominator (the bottom part), where both
  integers can be limited-range basic and unlimited-range integers.
  The mathematical value of a rational number is the numerator divided
  by the denominator.
  This tag can express all numbers that the extended generic data
  model of {{-orig}} can express, except for non-finites {{IEEE754}}; it
  also can express rational numbers that cannot be expressed with
  denominators that are a power of 2 or a power of 10.

  For example, the rational number 1/3 is encoded:

  ~~~cbor-pretty
    d8 1e      ---- Tag 30
       82      ---- Array length 2
          01   ---- 1
          03   ---- 3
  ~~~

  Many programming languages have built-in support for rational
  numbers or support for them is included in their standard libraries;
  tag number 30 is a way for these platforms to interchange these
  rational numbers in CBOR.

* Tag numbers 4 and 5 are limited in the range of the (base 10 or base
  2) exponents by the limited-range integers in the basic generic data
  model.  Tag numbers 264 and 265 are exactly equivalent to 4 and 5,
  respectively, but also allow unlimited-range integers as exponents.
  While applications for floating point numbers with exponents outside
  the CBOR basic integer range are limited, tags 264 and 265 allow
  unlimited roundtripping with other formats that allow very large or
  very small exponents, such as those JSON {{-json}} can provide if the
  limitations of I-JSON {{-ijson}} do not apply.

The tag numbers 268..270 extend these tags further by providing a way
to express non-finites within a tag with this number.  This does not
increase the expressiveness of the data model (the non-finites can
already be expressed using major type 7 floating point numbers), but
does allow both finite and non-finite values to carry the same tag.
In most applications, a choice that includes some of the three tags
30, 264, 265 for finite values and major type 7 floating point values
for non-finites (as well as possibly other parts of the CBOR number
system) will be the preferred solution.

This document suggests using the CDDL typenames defined in
{{arith-tags-cddl}} for the three most useful tag numbers in this section.

~~~ cddl
rational = #6.30([numerator: integer, denominator: integer .ne 0])
rational_of<N,D> = #6.30([numerator: N, denominator: D])
; the value 1/3 can be notated as rational_of<1, 3>

extended_decfrac = #6.264([e10: integer, m: integer])
extended_bigfloat = #6.265([e2: integer, m: integer])
~~~
{: #arith-tags-cddl title="CDDL for extended arithmetic tags"}

## Variants of undefined

`https://github.com/svaarala/cbor-specs/blob/master/cbor-absent-tag.rst`
defines tag 31 to be applied to the CBOR value Undefined (0xf7),
slightly modifying its semantics to stand for an absent value in a
CBOR Array.

## Typed and Homogeneous Arrays

{{!RFC8746}} defines tags for various kinds of arrays.  A summary is
reproduced in {{arraytags}}.

## Extended Time Formats

Additional tag definitions have been provided for date and time values.

|  Tag | Data Item   | Semantics                          | Reference     |
|  100 | integer     | date in number of days since epoch | {{?RFC8943}}  |
| 1004 | text string | RFC 3339 full-date string          | {{?RFC8943}}  |
| 1001 | map         | extended time                      | {{-time-tag}} |
| 1002 | map         | duration                           | {{-time-tag}} |
| 1003 | map         | period                             | {{-time-tag}} |
{: #timetags cols='r l l' title="Tag numbers for date and time"}

Note that tags 100 and 1004 are for calendar dates that are not
anchored to a specific time zone; they are meant to specify calendar
dates as perceived by humans, e.g. for use in personal identification
documents.
Converting such a calendar date into a specific point in time needs the
addition of a time-of-day (for which a CBOR tag is outstanding) and
timezone information (also outstanding).  Alternatively, a calendar
date plus timezone information can be converted into a time period
(range of time values given by the starting and the ending time); note
that these time periods are not always exactly 24 h (86400 s) long.

{{?RFC8943}} does not suggest CDDL {{-cddl}} type names for the two tags.
We suggest copying the definitions in {{time-tags-cddl}} into
application-specific CDDL as needed.

~~~ cddl
caldate = #6.100(int) ; calendar date as a number of days from 1970-01-01
tcaldate = #6.1004(tstr) ; calendar date as an RFC 3339 full-date string
~~~
{: #time-tags-cddl title="CDDL for calendar date tags (RFC8943)"}

Tag 1001 extends tag 1 by additional information (such as picosecond
resolution) and allows the use of Decimal and Bigfloat numbers for the
time.

Tag number 262 has been registered to identify byte strings that carry embedded
JSON text (`https://github.com/toravir/CBOR-Tag-Specs/blob/master/embeddedJSON.md`).

Tag number 275 can be used to identify maps that contain keys that are

## Weird text encodings

(TO DO: Obtain permission to copy the definitions here.)


Some variants of UTF-8 are in use in specific areas of application.
Tags have been registered to be able to carry around strings in these
variants in case they are not also valid UTF-8 and can therefore not
be represented as a CBOR text string
(`https://github.com/svaarala/cbor-specs/blob/master/cbor-nonutf8-string-tags.rst`).

## Enumerated Alternative Data Items

(Original Text for this section was contributed by Duncan Coutts and
Michael Peyton Jones; all errors are the author's.)

A set of CBOR tag numbers has been allocated (to do, {{iana}}) for
encoding data composed of enumerated alternatives:

|       Tags | Data Item          | Meaning                                 |
|   121..127 | any                | alternatives 0..6, 1+1 encoding         |
| 1280..1400 | any                | alternatives 7..127, 1+2 encoding       |
|        101 | array \[uint, any] | alternatives as given by the uint + 128 |
{: #tab-tag-enum cols='r l l' title="Tags for Enumerated Alternative Data Items"}

The tags defined in this section are for encoding data that can be
in one of a number of different enumerated forms.

For example data representing the result of some action might be either
a failure with some failure detail, or a success with some result. In
this example there are two cases, the failure case and the success case,
and we can enumerate them as 0 and 1.

In general the number of alternatives, and what data is expected in each
alternative case is entirely application dependent.

The tags defined in this specification allow the encoding of any number
of alternatives, but provide compact encoding for the common cases of
low numbers of alternatives:

-   Alternatives 0..6 can be encoded in 2 bytes;

-   Alternatives 7..127 can be encoded in 3 bytes;

-   Alternatives 128+ can be encoded in 3-12 bytes.

There are no special considerations for deterministic encoding
{{Section 4.2 of STD94}}: The case numbers covered by each tag do not
overlap; particularly, tag 101 encoding starts where the more compact
special encodings for 0..6 and 7..127 end.

For cases 0..6 and 7..127, the tag value indicates the value of the alternatives.
For cases 128+, then a single tag value announces the format, and the value within the array indicates the value.

### Semantics

The value consists of a case number and a case body. The case number is
an unsigned integer that indicates which case out of the set of
alternatives is used. The case body is any CBOR data value.

In a setting where the application uses a schema (formally or
informally), then there will be an appropriate sub-schema for each case
in the set of alternatives. The representation of the case body should
comply with the schema corresponding to the case number used.

To continue the example above about representing failure or success,
suppose that the failure detail consists of an integer code and a
string, and suppose that the successful result is a byte string. A
failure value will use case 0 and the case body will be a CBOR list
containing an integer and a text string. Alternatively, a success value
will use case 1 and the body will be a single CBOR byte string.

Decoders that enforce a schema must check the case number is within the
range of cases allowed, and that the case body follows the schema for
the supplied case number. Generic decoders should allow any case number
and any CBOR data value for the case body.

### Rationale

CBOR has direct support for *combinations* of multiple values but not
for *alternatives* of multiple values. Combinations are expressed in
CBOR using lists or maps.

Most programming languages have a notion of data consisting of
combinations of data values, often called records or objects. Many
programming languages also have a notion of data consisting of multiple
alternative data values. For example C has unions, and other languages
have "tagged" unions (where it is always clear which alternative is in
use).

Crucially for this set of tags, the set of alternatives must be closed
and ordered. This allows encoding using an unsigned number to distinguish
each case.

Note that this does *not* correspond to the notion in some programming
languages of classes and subclasses since in that context the set of
alternatives is open and unordered. Alternatives of this kind are
well-supported by tag 27 "Serialized language-independent object with
type name and constructor arguments".

In functional programming languages, the primary way of forming new data
types is to enumerate a set of alternatives (each of which may be a
record). Such forms of data are also supported in hybrid functional
languages or languages with functional features.

Thus, in some applications, it is very common to have data making use of
alternatives, and it is worth finding a compact encoding, at least for
the common cases. Just as most records are small, most alternatives are
also small.

In this specification we reserve 7 values in the 2-byte part of the
available tag encoding space for alternatives 0..6 which are by far the
most common. We reserve a range of 121 values in the 3-bytes tag
encoding space. To cover the general case we use an encoding using a
pair consisting of an unsigned integer and the case body, the first 24
of which also result in a 3-byte encoding.

### Examples

To elaborate on the example from the introduction, we have a "result"
that is a failure or success, where:

-   the failure detail consists of an integer code and a string;
-   the successful result is a byte string.

This corresponds to the following schema, in CDDL notation:

~~~ cddl
result = #6.121([int, text])
       / #6.122(bytes)
~~~

Example values:

~~~ cbor-diag
121([3, "the printer is on fire"])
~~~
~~~ cbor-diag
122(h'ff00')
~~~

As a second example, here is one based on a data type defined within the
Haskell programming language, representing a simple expression tree.

~~~ haskell
-- A data type representing simple arithmetic expressions

data Expr = Lit Int -- integer literal
| Add Expr Expr -- addition
| Sub Expr Expr -- subtraction
| Neg Expr -- unary negation
| Mul Expr Expr -- multiplication
| Div Expr Expr -- integer division
~~~

In CDDL notation, and using the tags in this specification, such data
could be encoded using this schema:

~~~ cddl
; A data type representing simple arithmetic expressions

expr = 121(int)          ; integer literal
     / 122([expr, expr]) ; addition
     / 123([expr, expr]) ; subtraction
     / 124(expr)         ; unary negation
     / 125([expr, expr]) ; multiplication
     / 126([expr, expr]) ; integer division
~~~

# Implementation aids

## Invalid Tag

The present document registers tag numbers 65535, 4294967295, and
18446744073709551615 (16-bit 0xffff, 32-bit 0xffffffff, and 64-bit
0xffffffffffffffff) as Invalid Tags, tags that are always invalid,
independent of the tag content provided.  The purpose of these tag
number registrations is to enable the tag numbers to be reserved for
internal use by implementations to note the absence of a tag on a data
item where a tag could also be expected with that data item as tag
content.

The Invalid Tags are not intended to ever occur in interchanged CBOR
data items.  Generic CBOR decoder implementations are encouraged to
raise an error if an Invalid Tag occurs in a CBOR data item even if
there is no validity checking implemented otherwise.

IANA Considerations {#iana}
============

In the registry "{{cbor-tags (CBOR Tags)<IANA.cbor-tags}}" {{IANA.cbor-tags}},
IANA has allocated the first to third tag in {{tab-tag-values}} from the
FCFS space, with the present document as the specification reference.
IANA has allocated the fourth tag from the Specification
Required space, with the present document as the specification reference.

{: #tab-tag-values cols='r l l' title="Values for Tags"}

In addition, IANA is requested to allocate the tags from
{{tab-tag-enum}}, with a reference to the present document.

Security Considerations
============

The security considerations of {{-cbor}} apply; the tags discussed here
may also have specific security considerations that are mentioned in
their specific sections above.
